# Twitter-Keyword-Search
This Python script provides a way to search for tweets on twitter using keywords or hastags. You can also livestream the tweets so that you get the most current tweets using that keyword or hash tag

The search.py lets you choose between livestreaming the tweets, analyzing the tweets or search for the tweets. The analysing 
option lets you see if those tweets are considered negative, postive, or neutral and you are able to see a pie chart after the
code runs. This information is then imported into a .json file which you can name. 


the  mine.py converts the json file to a csv file. However, you have to pick the fields that you want to imported into csv.
